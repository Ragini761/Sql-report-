# Sql-report-
# Project Description
Ig_clone data analysis project contains several tables which has data related to 
users, photos, tags used etc. , from this data as a data analyst i need to find the 
result or related information which going to be useful for upgrading as well as 
marketing purpose.
# Approach
My approach is simple and easy to do 
1) Analyse the data carefully, to find and null and blank cell or false entry.
2) Then after that need to find the connection between all the table so that it will 
be easier to link the tables to gather the required information.
3) After that as per requirement need to write some question and according to 
that we need to write query.
4) Writing query will give filtered data and we need to check that result is up to
mark or not.
5) After getting several operations done need to summarise the results to make 
a report which will be easier to understand for everyone.
#  Tech-Stack Used
For this project I’m using SqlSever.
# Insights
Getting results by writing the query I get to know that people are using bots to like 
the photos and generating fake publicity . Even with the help of SQL I’m able to know 
that how often people upload photos, which day most of the user lie to register,
which kind of hashtags is used and more.
# Result
By doing this project I’m able to join multiple tables to gather information’s, I
used different function to get exact result, now I’m able to write subquery as 
well. It helps me to improve my problem-solving skill as well as thinking 
capability.
